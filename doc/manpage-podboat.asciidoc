== XDG Base Directory Support

Podboat defaults to storing everything in _$HOME/.newsboat_ directory. If
you prefer XDG, create _$HOME/.config/newsboat_ and
_$HOME/.local/share/newsboat_ directories, and Podboat will use them from
there on.

If you already have some files in _$HOME/.newsboat/_, move the _queue_ file to
_$HOME/.local/share/newsboat/_, and that should be it.

See also a corresponding section in newsboat(1).
