== XDG Base Directory Support

Podboat defaults to storing everything in '$HOME/.newsboat' directory. If
you prefer XDG, create '$HOME/.config/newsboat' and
'$HOME/.local/share/newsboat' directories, and Podboat will use them from
there on.

If you already have some files in '$HOME/.newsboat/', move the 'queue' file to
'$HOME/.local/share/newsboat/', and that should be it.

See also a corresponding section in newsboat(1).
